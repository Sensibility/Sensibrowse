Sensibrowse
===========

Sensibrowse is small, lightweight, and sensible web browser. It is based on the [litebrowser-linux](https://github.com/litehtml/litebrowser-linux) project (but is not a direct fork just because of issues I had cloning a sub-repo) and it uses the [litehtml](https://github.com/litehtml/litehtml) rendering engine.
